hello huffman
this is a test
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm. 
It assigns variable-length codes to input characters, 
with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. 

This is a test file for the Huffman Text Compressor project. 
We will use it to check if our compressor and decompressor work correctly. 

Feel free to add more text to increase the file size and test compression efficiency. 
The more data we add, the better we can see the compression performance.
